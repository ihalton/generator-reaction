# generator-reaction

[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/reactioncommerce/generator-reaction.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/reactioncommerce/generator-reaction)

This is a [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator plugin used by [Reaction Commerce](https://www.reactioncommerce.com/) developers. The main generator creates a new project. There are also subgenerators for creating a new NPM package project and for quickly adding GraphQL files to the main Reaction project.

## Installation

First, globally install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-reaction using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo generator-reaction
```

### NPM Link

If you are adding or modifying generators in this package, you can test them prior to publishing by running `npm link` in the generator project's root directory to make the template available globally on your system.

```bash
npm link
```

## Generate a new frontend or backend Node project

```bash
mkdir project-name
cd project-name
yo reaction
```

## Generate a new NPM package project

```bash
mkdir package-name
cd package-name
yo reaction:npm
```

## Generate GraphQL files in the main Reaction app

```bash
yo reaction:graphql
```
